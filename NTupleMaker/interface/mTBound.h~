/**
  
Copyright Christopher Lester.  Please contact Alan Barr or Christopher Lester if you wish to incorporate it in your code.  We will grant permission (!) but just want to have an idea of whether the code is un use.

This code evaluates a kinematic variable, mTBound, providing a maximal lower bound on the mass of a resonance R undergoing the decay decay:

R -> IJ

followed by           I -> SP

and                   J -> TQ

where I and J have the same mass ("mIntermediate"), and where
the intermediate mass constraint
is enforced, where P and Q are invisible and only constrained by
the sum of their transverse componente (ptmiss).


If you use this code, please cite the paper where we introduced this variable in the context  
of H -> tau tau decays:

http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.2322

A negative return value of -10 means that mBound does not exist (this is
a legitimate possibility.  See the papers above!)  Any other negative return value
suggests an internal error in the implementation and should be reported to the
authors together with a simple test program reproducing the problem.


To evaluate mTBound call the function 

double Lester::mTBound(...)

defined below.  Note that to use this code you must edit FlatRandom.h to make it contain a routine that returns high-quality random numbers in the range [0,1).

  const bool MTBOUND_DEBUG = false;

  /// This is an implementation of what is written up in Lab Book 8B.  Roughly page 20.  Note that HiggsTauTauMassLesterAtFixedKxKy is a utility for calculating the mass of a progenitor particle (the "Higgs") under the assumption that it decayed toWW and thence to l nu l nu under the assumption that the transverse momentum splitting between the neutrinos is KNOWN (this is what is parametrised by kx and ky).  Given that splitting, this implementation finds the e and z components of the neutrinos that satisfy the on-shell mass constrains for the two W-bosons (if this is possible) and then finds the (smallest sensible) invariant mass of a higgs resulting therefrom.

  /* "wasSillyRef" is "true" on exit if and only if there is a problem of some kind. 

  Possible returns of "HelperFunctionHiggsTauTauMassLesterAtFixedKxKy" are as follows:

  (1) If wasSillyRef=false, then returnValue guarenteed>=0 and sensible.

  (2) If wasSillyRef=true, then:

  (2a) If returnValue>=0 then returnValue is BIG (>14000) and is a measure of
  how badly the kx and ky were outside the physuical region.

  (2b) If returnValue<0 then either returnValue is -2 or -3.

  -2 should be very rare (I have never seen it happen) but it could perhaps happen due to rare rounding errors.  It would indicate that no real energies could be found for kx and ky splittings deemed to be in the valid region (by test of discriminant).

  -3 should never happen at all.  It would indicate a logic bug in the last part of the code.

    How the calculation proceeds:

    First stage:
       
    Random (memoryless) splittings, parametrised by kx,ky, are repeatedly generated until either:

    (a) a valid kx and ky in the physical region is discovered (...AtFixedKxKy signals this with "wasSilly=false"), or
   
    (b) a number of attempts (eg 10,000) has been exhausted.
    
    During this memoryless search, all the while no "good" point has been found, the "best of the silly" points is nonetheless retained (i.e. the silly point whose negative discriminants have been least negative thus far) so that this may serve as a "best guess, even though un[physical" suitable start poing for the second stage of the calculation, which is memory full.

    At the end of this second state, a valid start point (even if it is "silly", i.e. "unphysical" should have been found.  The only circumstance in which it might not have been found is if every splitting registered a negative error code return from the underlying utility, which ought basically to be impossible.  If such a thing were to happen haveValidStartPoint would remain false, and we would return -15.  This should almost NEVER happen!  The universe would more likely grow cold before that will happen.  A return of -15, if seen, is more likley to indicate a bug in this code.

    Second stage:

    Now a markov chain minimiser attempts to find the splitting that leads to the smallest higgs mass (or smallest "silly" higgs mass if we are still outside the physical region and are therefore adding 14000 to discriminats etc).  Even if we were intially in an unphysical region, we will hopefully drop into the physical one here, if it exists.

    If ultimately we never found how to get into the physical region (it may not exist!) we return -10.

    Otherwise, we return the smallest (physical) progenitor mass that was found among all splittings searched.  This will be >=0.
